            <p class="blog-meta">Published on: March 23, 2022 | Author: Aaditya Kshetri</p>

        <div class="blog-body">
            <p>Free speech is one of the basic fundamental right of a citizen and the major principal journalism is based on. We do think we are practicing right to free speech but what we are practicing is right to free speech bound by the law. There is a difference and that’s the difference Elon musk seeks to remove by his agenda of using Twitter for Free Speech. 
                For such ‘bound’ Freedom of speech  , the boundary is transitional, depending on the ruling vs opposing party’s voice, Government’s vs People’s Voice and so on. Like every person have different view on same thing , Journalist Sajana Baral had a not so distinct thought from all the critics worldwide on Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter. The description on Implementation of Free Speech on developed nation was fairly pointed out by many famous legal and concerned personalities . However the Indian Journalists and the critics believe that Elon Musk did not had any idea on how it would affect the third world and developing countries. It could be true to the farthest extent. It is projected that the Free speech will also brings more hate speech among people on different bases causing conflict and chaos . India being the 4th biggest platform for twitter have a greater chance to be impacted by the Change . And its impact on Indians vary too. Anyone familiar with the recent Indian politics may have realized that it didn’t required Free Speech to cause CAA , Farm Bills and Bull dozer justice . The variation and indifference has been causing the chaos on India even before twitter . The Indian Government has banned accounts and removed tweets against people with 9 court orders and 4894 police or other orders according to Stattista. It ranks fairly among top countries to do so.The infamous ‘Facebook algorithm on hate speech’ has been existing on India which have about 10 times more reach on Indian citizens . This is one of the thing that people fear twitter would turn out to be under Elon musk .
                </p>
            <p>    <b>◦	Impact on Nepal </b> </p> <p>

                It would be very unfair to judge Nepal or any other third world country to have the same impact as Indian . India is one of the world power countries and Nepal have a lot to achieve to be viewed at the same level . Nepal barely have 0.41 million users and projected to be 0.44 million user by 2025 which is about 13% of today’s population. Similarly the free speech among social media is barely censored  except for few unhealthy critics . Nepal has 5 post removal from twitter as of first six month of 2021 . Nepal have almost 12million Facebook users though. As things stand the Facebook algorithm and content illiteracy has more chances to be creating the misfortunes world is expecting on third world than twitter’s acquisition and transformation.
                
                Hence, Elon Musk tends to be the Richer Julian Assange to the world. The impact may differ from country to country but the biggest thing Elon Musk see is a world with better transparency and voice of people. As an American author said ”Pain can only hurt you as much as you want it “ Countries that fear can always switch to Censorship on twitter .</p>
